# The Studentizer
The Studentizer is a **student management program** that offers insertion of students based on a unique **ID** and a **name**, 
editing by **ID** and deletion by **ID**. The students can be imported from the user's keyboard or a binary file where they will
be updated with every change. Otherwise, a file with your desired name will be created and all of the students will be saved
to it
